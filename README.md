# Discord-Date-and-Time-Converter
This project is a way to convert the date and time into a format that discord can read and hence display the time according to where the user is.

For example:
2024/6/20 2:25pm is <t:1718864700.0:F>

If you have any questions or bug reports, feel free to drop a comment and I'll try my best to read it!
Do note that this project was just a fun side project of mine to get used to coding in python, so spaghetti code is to be expected.
