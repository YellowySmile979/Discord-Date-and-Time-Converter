# INTRODUCTIONS
This project is a way to convert any chosen date and time (before Jan 1st 2024 00:00) into a format that Discord can read.
This allows anyone who sees the timestamp to be able to read it in their local time without you or them having to go through the trouble of searching up a website.

# EXAMPLE:
2024/6/20 2:25pm is <t:1718864700.0:F>

# HOW TO DOWNLOAD/PULL
## For those who want the .exe:
  - On the right hand side of the main Code page, find the "Releases" tab
  - Then click on the LATEST version to download the .zip file
  - Extract it and open the .exe and you are good to go!

## For those who want the source code:
  - Please navigate to the Pull Requests tab and request to pull
  - Alternatively, you can also clone the repo or open the repo in Github Dektop
    - NOTE: If you open this repo in Github Desktop without cloning the repo, you are still working on THIS repo.
    - So be careful and do take note if you intend to modify or change code.

# CONCLUSION
If you have any questions or bug reports, feel free to drop a comment and I'll try my best to read it!
Do note that this project was just a fun side project of mine to get used to coding in python, so my code may not be as efficient as it should be.
